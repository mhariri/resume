Dear sir/madam,

    I have 20 years of experience in software development, in companies of different sizes and phases ranging from early startups to well-oiled large companies such as Spotify.

    I am an avid reader and enjoy spending time sharing my experience and knowledge with less senior engineers. I am a huge fan of pair programming as a great mechanism to teach and learn coding and technical concepts.

    I have lived in 3 continents, moved to Vancouver from Stockholm a year ago, and would like to continue working from Vancouver.

    Best Regards,
    Mohsen Hariri
